## How to Deploy

Currently, the project is hosted on https://visualmatcher.netlify.app/ using Netlify.

# Running Locally

First make sure all dependencies are there in the root (frontend_epxress_app directory) by running `npm install` from frontend_express_app run `node app.js`. In another directory, go to the frontend_express_app/client directory, run `npm install` to get all the dependencies, then run `npm start`.
